A GUI configuration tool for configuring Pipewire

This project is partially a tool for me to learn the QT framework in C++, and partially a tool to make it much easier for end users to configure Pipewire to their individual needs.

# Roadmap:
Alpha 0.0.1 GUI interface
0.0.2 Creating copies (if the files do not already exist in ~/.config/pipewire ) and linking the variables in the configuration files to the application
0.1 Successfully being able to modify the pre-defined variables within the 
Beta 0.1.1 Adding the creation of custom rules for individual applications
1.0 Bugtests and final release
